{\bfseries A powerful yet easy-\/to-\/use P\+HP micro-\/framework designed to help you build dynamic and robust \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} applications -\/ fast!}

\href{https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=phpfatfree&url=https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree}{\tt }

Condensed in a single $\sim$65\+KB file, \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} (as we fondly call it) gives you solid foundation, a mature code base, and a no-\/nonsense approach to writing \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} applications. Under the hood is an easy-\/to-\/use \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} development tool kit, a high-\/performance U\+RL routing and cache engine, built-\/in code highlighting, and support for multilingual applications. It\textquotesingle{}s lightweight, easy-\/to-\/use, and fast. Most of all, it doesn\textquotesingle{}t get in your way.

Whether you\textquotesingle{}re a novice or an expert P\+HP programmer, \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} will get you up and running in no time. No unnecessary and painstaking installation procedures. No complex configuration required. No convoluted directory structures. There\textquotesingle{}s no better time to start developing \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} applications the easy way than right now!

\hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} supports both S\+QL and No\+S\+QL databases off-\/the-\/shelf\+: My\+S\+QL, S\+Q\+Lite, M\+S\+S\+Q\+L/\+Sybase, Postgre\+S\+QL, D\+B2, and Mongo\+DB. It also comes with powerful object-\/relational mappers for data abstraction and modeling that are just as lightweight as the framework. No configuration needed.

That\textquotesingle{}s not all. \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} is packaged with other optional plug-\/ins that extend its capabilities\+:-\/


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fast and clean template engine,
\item Unit testing toolkit,
\item Database-\/managed sessions with automatic C\+S\+RF protection,
\item Markdown-\/to-\/\+H\+T\+ML converter,
\item Atom/\+R\+SS feed reader,
\item \hyperlink{class_image}{Image} processor,
\item Geodata handler,
\item Google static maps,
\item On-\/the-\/fly Javascript/\+C\+SS compressor,
\item Open\+ID (consumer),
\item Custom logger,
\item Basket/\+Shopping cart,
\item Pingback server/consumer,
\item Unicode-\/aware string functions,
\item \hyperlink{class_s_m_t_p}{S\+M\+TP} over S\+S\+L/\+T\+LS,
\item Tools for communicating with other servers,
\item And more in a tiny supercharged package!
\end{DoxyItemize}

Unlike other frameworks, \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} aims to be usable -\/ not usual.

\href{https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=phpfatfree&url=https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree}{\tt }

The philosophy behind the framework and its approach to software architecture is towards minimalism in structural components, avoiding application complexity and striking a balance between code elegance, application performance and programmer productivity.

Fat-\/\+Free Framework makes it easy to build entire \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} sites in a jiffy. With the same power and brevity as modern Javascript toolkits and libraries, \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} helps you write better-\/looking and more reliable P\+HP programs. One glance at your P\+HP source code and anyone will find it easy to understand, how much you can accomplish in so few lines of code, and how powerful the results are.

\hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} is one of the best documented frameworks around. Learning it costs next to nothing. No strict set of difficult-\/to-\/navigate directory structures and obtrusive programming steps. No truck load of configuration options just to display {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}Hello, World\textquotesingle{}} in your browser. Fat-\/\+Free gives you a lot of freedom -\/ and style -\/ to get more work done with ease and in less time.

\hyperlink{class_f3}{F3}\textquotesingle{}s declarative approach to programming makes it easy for novices and experts alike to understand P\+HP code. If you\textquotesingle{}re familiar with the programming language Ruby, you\textquotesingle{}ll notice the resemblance between Fat-\/\+Free and Sinatra micro-\/framework because they both employ a simple Domain-\/\+Specific Language for Re\+S\+Tful \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} services. But unlike Sinatra and its P\+HP incarnations (Fitzgerald, Limonade, Glue -\/ to name a few), Fat-\/\+Free goes beyond just handling routes and requests. Views can be in any form, such as plain text, H\+T\+ML, X\+ML or an e-\/mail message. The framework comes with a fast and easy-\/to-\/use template engine. \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} also works seamlessly with other template engines, including Twig, Smarty, and P\+HP itself. Models communicate with \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3}\textquotesingle{}s data mappers and the S\+QL helper for more complex interactions with various database engines. Other plug-\/ins extend the base functionality even more. It\textquotesingle{}s a total \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} development framework -\/ with a lot of muscle!

\subsubsection*{Enough Said -\/ See For Yourself}

Unzip the contents of the distribution package anywhere in your hard drive. By default, the framework file and optional plug-\/ins are located in the {\ttfamily lib/} path. Organize your directory structures any way you want. You may move the default folders to a path that\textquotesingle{}s not Web-\/accessible for better security. Delete the plug-\/ins that you don\textquotesingle{}t need. You can always restore them later and \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} will detect their presence automatically.

{\bfseries Important\+:} If your application uses A\+PC, Memcached, Win\+Cache, X\+Cache, or a filesystem cache, clear all cache entries first before overwriting an older version of the framework with a new one.

Make sure you\textquotesingle{}re running the right version of P\+HP. \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} does not support versions earlier than P\+HP 5.\+3. You\textquotesingle{}ll be getting syntax errors (false positives) all over the place because new language constructs and closures/anonymous functions are not supported by outdated P\+HP versions. To find out, open your console ({\ttfamily bash} shell on G\+N\+U/\+Linux, or {\ttfamily cmd.\+exe} on Windows)\+:-\/


\begin{DoxyCode}
/path/to/php -v
\end{DoxyCode}


P\+HP will let you know which particular version you\textquotesingle{}re running and you should get something that looks similar to this\+:-\/


\begin{DoxyCode}
PHP 5.3.15 (cli) (built: Jul 20 2012 00:20:38)
Copyright (c) 1997-2012 The PHP Group

\subsubsection*{Hello, World\+: The Less-\/\+Than-\/\+A-\/\+Minute Fat-\/\+Free Recipe}

Time to start writing our first application\+:-\/


\begin{DoxyCode}
$f3 = require('path/to/base.php');
$f3->route('GET /',
    function() \{
        echo 'Hello, world!';
    \}
);
$f3->run();
\end{DoxyCode}


Prepend {\ttfamily \hyperlink{base_8php_source}{base.\+php}} on the first line with the appropriate path. Save the above code fragment as {\ttfamily \hyperlink{index_8php_source}{index.\+php}} in your \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} root folder. We\textquotesingle{}ve written our first \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} page.

The first command tells the P\+HP interpreter that you want the framework\textquotesingle{}s functions and features available to your application. The {\ttfamily \$f3-\/$>$route()} method informs Fat-\/\+Free that a \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} page is available at the relative U\+RL indicated by the slash ({\ttfamily /}). Anyone visiting your site located at {\ttfamily \href{http://www.example.com/}{\tt http\+://www.\+example.\+com/}} will see the {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}Hello, world!\textquotesingle{}} message because the U\+RL {\ttfamily /} is equivalent to the root page. To create a route that branches out from the root page, like {\ttfamily \href{http://www.example.com/inside/}{\tt http\+://www.\+example.\+com/inside/}}, you can define another route with a simple {\ttfamily G\+ET /inside} string.

The route described above tells the framework to render the page only when it receives a U\+RL request using the H\+T\+TP {\ttfamily G\+ET} method. More complex \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} sites containing forms use other H\+T\+TP methods like {\ttfamily P\+O\+ST}, and you can also implement that as part of a {\ttfamily \$f3-\/$>$route()} specification.

If the framework sees an incoming request for your \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} page located at the root U\+RL {\ttfamily /}, it will automatically route the request to the callback function, which contains the code necessary to process the request and render the appropriate H\+T\+ML stuff. In this example, we just send the string {\ttfamily \textquotesingle{}Hello, world!\textquotesingle{}} to the user\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} browser.

So we\textquotesingle{}ve established our first route. But that won\textquotesingle{}t do much, except to let \hyperlink{class_f3}{F3} know that there\textquotesingle{}s a process that will handle it and there\textquotesingle{}s some text to display on the user\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} browser. If you have a lot more pages on your site, you need to set up different routes for each group. For now, let\textquotesingle{}s keep it simple. To instruct the framework to start waiting for requests, we issue the {\ttfamily \$f3-\/$>$run()} command.

{\bfseries Can\textquotesingle{}t Get the Example Running?} If you\textquotesingle{}re having trouble getting this simple program to run on your server, you may have to tweak your \hyperlink{class_web}{Web} server settings a bit. Take a look at the sample Apache configuration in the following section (along with the Nginx and Lighttpd equivalents).

{\bfseries Still having trouble?} Make sure the `\$f3 = require(\textquotesingle{}path/to/base.\+php\textquotesingle{});{\ttfamily assignment comes before any output in your script.}\hyperlink{base_8php_source}{base.\+php}` modifies the H\+T\+TP headers, so any character that is output to the browser before this assignment will cause errors.

\subsection*{Routing Engine}

\subsubsection*{Overview}

Our first example wasn\textquotesingle{}t too hard to swallow, was it? If you like a little more flavor in your Fat-\/\+Free soup, insert another route before the {\ttfamily \$f3-\/$>$run()} command\+:-\/


\begin{DoxyCode}
$f3->route('GET /about',
    function() \{
        echo 'Donations go to a local charity... us!';
    \}
);
\end{DoxyCode}


You don\textquotesingle{}t want to clutter the global namespace with function names? Fat-\/\+Free recognizes different ways of mapping route handlers to O\+OP classes and methods\+:-\/


\begin{DoxyCode}
class WebPage \{
    function display() \{
        echo 'I cannot object to an object';
    \}
\}

$f3->route('GET /about','WebPage->display');
\end{DoxyCode}


H\+T\+TP requests can also be routed to static class methods\+:-\/


\begin{DoxyCode}
$f3->route('GET /login','Auth::login');
\end{DoxyCode}


Passed arguments are always provided as the second parameter\+:

``` php \$f3-\/$>$route(\textquotesingle{}G\+ET /hello/
