\fBA powerful yet easy-to-use PHP micro-framework designed to help you build dynamic and robust \fBWeb\fP applications - fast!\fP
.PP
\fC\fP.PP
Condensed in a single ~65KB file, \fBF3\fP (as we fondly call it) gives you solid foundation, a mature code base, and a no-nonsense approach to writing \fBWeb\fP applications\&. Under the hood is an easy-to-use \fBWeb\fP development tool kit, a high-performance URL routing and cache engine, built-in code highlighting, and support for multilingual applications\&. It's lightweight, easy-to-use, and fast\&. Most of all, it doesn't get in your way\&.
.PP
Whether you're a novice or an expert PHP programmer, \fBF3\fP will get you up and running in no time\&. No unnecessary and painstaking installation procedures\&. No complex configuration required\&. No convoluted directory structures\&. There's no better time to start developing \fBWeb\fP applications the easy way than right now!
.PP
\fBF3\fP supports both SQL and NoSQL databases off-the-shelf: MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL/Sybase, PostgreSQL, DB2, and MongoDB\&. It also comes with powerful object-relational mappers for data abstraction and modeling that are just as lightweight as the framework\&. No configuration needed\&.
.PP
That's not all\&. \fBF3\fP is packaged with other optional plug-ins that extend its capabilities:-

Unlike other frameworks, \fBF3\fP aims to be usable - not usual\&.
.PP
\fC\fP.PP
The philosophy behind the framework and its approach to software architecture is towards minimalism in structural components, avoiding application complexity and striking a balance between code elegance, application performance and programmer productivity\&.

Fat-Free Framework makes it easy to build entire \fBWeb\fP sites in a jiffy\&. With the same power and brevity as modern Javascript toolkits and libraries, \fBF3\fP helps you write better-looking and more reliable PHP programs\&. One glance at your PHP source code and anyone will find it easy to understand, how much you can accomplish in so few lines of code, and how powerful the results are\&.
.PP
\fBF3\fP is one of the best documented frameworks around\&. Learning it costs next to nothing\&. No strict set of difficult-to-navigate directory structures and obtrusive programming steps\&. No truck load of configuration options just to display \fC'Hello, World'\fP in your browser\&. Fat-Free gives you a lot of freedom - and style - to get more work done with ease and in less time\&.
.PP
\fBF3\fP's declarative approach to programming makes it easy for novices and experts alike to understand PHP code\&. If you're familiar with the programming language Ruby, you'll notice the resemblance between Fat-Free and Sinatra micro-framework because they both employ a simple Domain-Specific Language for ReSTful \fBWeb\fP services\&. But unlike Sinatra and its PHP incarnations (Fitzgerald, Limonade, Glue - to name a few), Fat-Free goes beyond just handling routes and requests\&. Views can be in any form, such as plain text, HTML, XML or an e-mail message\&. The framework comes with a fast and easy-to-use template engine\&. \fBF3\fP also works seamlessly with other template engines, including Twig, Smarty, and PHP itself\&. Models communicate with \fBF3\fP's data mappers and the SQL helper for more complex interactions with various database engines\&. Other plug-ins extend the base functionality even more\&. It's a total \fBWeb\fP development framework - with a lot of muscle!
.PP
.SS "Enough Said - See For Yourself"
.PP
Unzip the contents of the distribution package anywhere in your hard drive\&. By default, the framework file and optional plug-ins are located in the \fClib/\fP path\&. Organize your directory structures any way you want\&. You may move the default folders to a path that's not Web-accessible for better security\&. Delete the plug-ins that you don't need\&. You can always restore them later and \fBF3\fP will detect their presence automatically\&.
.PP
\fBImportant:\fP If your application uses APC, Memcached, WinCache, XCache, or a filesystem cache, clear all cache entries first before overwriting an older version of the framework with a new one\&.
.PP
Make sure you're running the right version of PHP\&. \fBF3\fP does not support versions earlier than PHP 5\&.3\&. You'll be getting syntax errors (false positives) all over the place because new language constructs and closures/anonymous functions are not supported by outdated PHP versions\&. To find out, open your console (\fCbash\fP shell on GNU/Linux, or \fCcmd\&.exe\fP on Windows):-
.PP
.PP
.nf
/path/to/php -v
.fi
.PP

PHP will let you know which particular version you're running and you should get something that looks similar to this:-

.SS "Hello, World: The Less-Than-A-Minute Fat-Free Recipe"
.PP
Time to start writing our first application:-
.PP
.PP
.nf
$f3 = require('path/to/base\&.php');
$f3->route('GET /',
    function() {
        echo 'Hello, world!';
    }
);
$f3->run();
.fi
.PP
.PP
Prepend \fC\fBbase\&.php\fP\fP on the first line with the appropriate path\&. Save the above code fragment as \fC\fBindex\&.php\fP\fP in your \fBWeb\fP root folder\&. We've written our first \fBWeb\fP page\&.
.PP
The first command tells the PHP interpreter that you want the framework's functions and features available to your application\&. The \fC$f3->route()\fP method informs Fat-Free that a \fBWeb\fP page is available at the relative URL indicated by the slash (\fC/\fP)\&. Anyone visiting your site located at \fChttp://www.example.com/\fP will see the \fC'Hello, world!'\fP message because the URL \fC/\fP is equivalent to the root page\&. To create a route that branches out from the root page, like \fChttp://www.example.com/inside/\fP, you can define another route with a simple \fCGET /inside\fP string\&.
.PP
The route described above tells the framework to render the page only when it receives a URL request using the HTTP \fCGET\fP method\&. More complex \fBWeb\fP sites containing forms use other HTTP methods like \fCPOST\fP, and you can also implement that as part of a \fC$f3->route()\fP specification\&.
.PP
If the framework sees an incoming request for your \fBWeb\fP page located at the root URL \fC/\fP, it will automatically route the request to the callback function, which contains the code necessary to process the request and render the appropriate HTML stuff\&. In this example, we just send the string \fC'Hello, world!'\fP to the user's \fBWeb\fP browser\&.
.PP
So we've established our first route\&. But that won't do much, except to let \fBF3\fP know that there's a process that will handle it and there's some text to display on the user's \fBWeb\fP browser\&. If you have a lot more pages on your site, you need to set up different routes for each group\&. For now, let's keep it simple\&. To instruct the framework to start waiting for requests, we issue the \fC$f3->run()\fP command\&.
.PP
\fBCan't Get the Example Running?\fP If you're having trouble getting this simple program to run on your server, you may have to tweak your \fBWeb\fP server settings a bit\&. Take a look at the sample Apache configuration in the following section (along with the Nginx and Lighttpd equivalents)\&.
.PP
\fBStill having trouble?\fP Make sure the `$f3 = require('path/to/base\&.php');\fCassignment comes before any output in your script\&.\fP\fBbase\&.php\fP` modifies the HTTP headers, so any character that is output to the browser before this assignment will cause errors\&.
.PP
.SS "Routing Engine"
.PP
.SS "Overview"
.PP
Our first example wasn't too hard to swallow, was it? If you like a little more flavor in your Fat-Free soup, insert another route before the \fC$f3->run()\fP command:-
.PP
.PP
.nf
$f3->route('GET /about',
    function() {
        echo 'Donations go to a local charity\&.\&.\&. us!';
    }
);
.fi
.PP
.PP
You don't want to clutter the global namespace with function names? Fat-Free recognizes different ways of mapping route handlers to OOP classes and methods:-
.PP
.PP
.nf
class WebPage {
    function display() {
        echo 'I cannot object to an object';
    }
}

$f3->route('GET /about','WebPage->display');
.fi
.PP
.PP
HTTP requests can also be routed to static class methods:-
.PP
.PP
.nf
$f3->route('GET /login','Auth::login');
.fi
.PP
.PP
Passed arguments are always provided as the second parameter:
.PP
``` php $f3->route('GET /hello/
